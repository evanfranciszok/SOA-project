# Motivation

* The motivation of your project, including the problem statement (the problem you aimed at solving) and your objectives.
* Motivation is dat ik een vegatarisch eet & sporter ben en ik het leuk vond om iets te maken wat mij zal helpen met het snel bedenken van avondeten.

Our project is motivated by the recognition of significant challenges in traditional meal planning methods and the desire to offer a solution that simplifies this process for users. The problem we aimed to solve stems from the time-consuming and often inefficient nature of meal planning, exacerbated by busy schedules, diverse dietary preferences, and the need to minimize food waste. Additionally, the lack of personalized recommendations and the manual effort required to manage pantry inventory and create shopping lists further compound these challenges.

Our primary objective is to develop an Intelligent Recipe and Meal Planning Application that addresses these pain points and empowers users to make informed decisions that align with their unique preferences, constraints, and lifestyle requirements. By leveraging modern technology, including advanced algorithms and microservices architecture, we aim to streamline the meal planning process, enhance user satisfaction, and promote healthier eating habits.

Specifically, our objectives include:

* Personalized Recommendations: Provide users with personalized recipe suggestions based on their dietary preferences, cooking skill level, and ingredient availability.
* Efficient Inventory Management: Enable users to efficiently manage their pantry inventory by tracking ingredient quantities, expiration dates, and usage patterns.
* Optimized Shopping Lists: Generate optimized shopping lists that take into account existing pantry inventory, planned meals, budgetary constraints, and nearby supermarket promotions.
* Simplified Meal Planning: Offer users a user-friendly interface for planning meals, incorporating recipe suggestions, pantry inventory, and shopping lists to facilitate efficient meal preparation and minimize food waste.
* Scalability and Flexibility: Design the application with a microservices architecture to ensure scalability, flexibility, and ease of integration with external services, allowing for future enhancements and expansions.

By addressing these objectives, we aim to revolutionize the meal planning experience, making it more convenient, enjoyable, and sustainable for users of our application. Through a combination of innovative technology and user-centered design, we strive to create a solution that not only meets the needs of today's users but also anticipates and adapts to their evolving preferences and lifestyle choices.

# Design decisions

* The more concrete/specific design decisions, by explaining why you did (and didn't ) use different technologies such as SOAP, REST and Message queue. Consider giving a summary table listing the services with the information about why you used (or did not use) these technologies and communication styles.

In the development of our Intelligent Recipe and Meal Planning Application, we made several concrete design decisions aimed at optimizing performance, scalability, and user experience. Each decision was carefully considered based on the specific requirements and characteristics of our application.

### Synchronous Communication

One of our design decisions was to employ synchronous communication between the Meal Planning Service and the Inventory Management Service, as well as between all services and the User Profile Service. This choice was made due to the relatively low computational overhead of these interactions, as both services are operated internally and do not require extensive processing. By utilizing simple HTTP requests, we ensure straightforward and efficient communication between these components.

### Asynchronous Communication with Message Queues

In contrast, we opted for asynchronous communication between the Shopping List Optimization Service and the Supermarket Services using message queues. This decision was motivated by the need to avoid blocking our application while fetching prices from third-party APIs, which could introduce delays and hinder responsiveness. By employing message queues, we can submit price inquiries in bulk and continue processing other tasks while awaiting responses. This approach enhances the overall efficiency and responsiveness of our application.

Currently, our implementation involves each supermarket having its own message queue, with a dedicated supermarket service listening to incoming price inquiries. Upon receiving a request, the service processes it and sends back a response containing the product ID, price, and store name, facilitating seamless integration with multiple supermarkets.

### Asynchronous Communication with Websockets

Additionally, we chose to implement asynchronous communication between the Meal Planning Application and the Meal Planning Service using websockets. This decision was driven by the need for real-time updates and a responsive user interface, particularly during the generation of recipe suggestions, which may involve waiting periods. By utilizing websockets, we ensure that results are delivered promptly to the client, even in scenarios where processing times vary.

Our current implementation includes an endpoint for retrieving user preferences via HTTP GET requests and a user interface for viewing and editing preferences. Similarly, a websocket connection facilitates communication between the Meal Planning Application and the Meal Planning Service, allowing for seamless interaction and real-time updates.
